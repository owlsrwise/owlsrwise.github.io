            <h3>My Professional Path</h3>
            <p>I have a passion for great design and creating solutions for others. My past work experiences in healthcare piqued my interest in software technologies, which is why I applied my problem-solving and soft skills to a new career path in software development. I have a keen eye for detail and am pragmatic in how I approach problems, whether it is to create a more efficient business process or to improve application usability. 
                <br><br>My current interests are full stack development, enterprise applications, and data science.

            <h3>Some Random Tidbits</h3>
            <p>I love to cook... <em>but not necessarily follow a recipe</em><br>
            Gardening is my therapy<br>
            I enjoy the natural sciences, technology, and art<br>
            Coffees <em>and</em> teas... why choose?<br>
            I dig puns and enjoy inventing portmanteaus<br>
            Always looking forward to the next hiking trip...</p>
